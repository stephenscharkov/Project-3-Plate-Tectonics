# Problem Statement:

  This project was given to better undersand tectonic plate motion and the effects this motion has on earthquakes. For this project 
  we will use the Juan de Fuca plate, which is off the west coast of the United states and Canada, and the differnet boundary conditions this
  plate comes with. Using data from a Ocean Bottom Seismometer we are able to analyze the Juan de Fuca plate movement over the past 10 years.
  The code is writen in python and will inform the user of seismic activity in this plate. 

# Results:
  
  In Figures 1.a to 1.d the maginutids are shown on a map with there raidas incease with larger earthquakes. Their colors also change with the severity of the earthquakes. The color bar on the side of the graph gives the scale of the severity. 
  In the following garphs the following assumptions were made: 
  
    1. Data collected from the Ocean Bottom Seismometer is accurate

  As seen in Figure 1.a most of the earthquakes that occure are at the plate boundaries, this is due to interations between the different plates casuing storied energy to be realced in the form of vibration. The Juan de Fuca Plate is unique in that it has all types of tectonic boundaries (Convection, Divergent, and Transform). For the Juan de Fuca Plate the range of maginutids seen is from 2.5 to 6.8 with the average maginutid being 3.1650072744907956. 
  In Figure 1.b the Month of April is shown in 2015. The most densely pack loaction of earthquakes is located in the middle of the west side of the Juan de Fuca Plate. This location on the plate boundary is called the Axial Seamount which is a volcano that irrupted in this month and was felt around the world. This can be seen in the riples in the southern part of Juan de Fuca Plate. The largest value from this month howevere is in the top of the plate.

  Figure 1.d: Earthquakes magnitudes of the Juan de Fuca Plate on the Transform
  
  Figures 1.c and 1.d are both on the Juan de Fuca Plate but are targeted regions on the plate. Figure 1.c is a Divergence boundary on the plate and Figure 1.d is a Transform. The patterns that can be made from this infroation is that more earthquakes occur at the Divergence boundary but more intence earthquakes will happen at the transform boundary. This information is matchs information I found on the cliffsnotes website.

  Table 1: Average, Minimum, Maximum values for Earthquakes on the Juan de Fuca Plate
  
  As seen in Table 1 we can see general trend from the Juan de Fuca Plate earthquakes. The most prevelent of trends being found in the average size of the earthquakes. Haveing the All data being the base line for infation we can see that both the Transform and April 2015 data are above average with the divergence data being below average.

   Figures 2.a to 2.d show scatter plots of the amplitudes of the earthquakes over time.
  
  
  # Conclusion:
  
  Accurate measurements of earthquakes can be made using infroation collected from Ocean Bottom Seismometer due to the mathcing data found about the Axial Seamount, Divergent and Transform Boundaries on the Juan de Fuca Plate.
