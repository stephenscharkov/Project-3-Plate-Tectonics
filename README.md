# Problem Statement:

  This project was given to better undersand tectonic plate motion and the effects this motion has on earthquakes. For this prject 
  we will use the Juan de Fuca plate, which is off the west coast of the United states and Canada, and the differnet boundary conditions this
  plate comes with. Using data from a Ocean Bottom Seismometer we are able to analyze the Juan de Fuca plate movement over the past 10 years.
  The code is writen in python and will inform the user of seismic activity in this plate. 

# Results:
  
  In Figures 1.a to 1.d the maginutids are shown on a map with there raidas incease with larger earthquakes. Their colors also change with the severity of the earthquakes. The color bar on the side of the graph gives the scale of the severity. 
  In the following garphs the following assumptions were made: 
  
    1. Data collected from the Ocean Bottom Seismometer is accurate

Map the earthquakes in April 2015(include this map inyour report). Where are those earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to? 

  As seen in Figure 1.a most of the earthquakes that occure are at the plate boundaries, this is due to interations between the different plates casuing storied energy to be realced in the form of vibration. The Juan de Fuca Plate is unique in that it has all types of tectonic boundaries (Convection, Divergent, and Transform). For the Juan de Fuca Plate the range of maginutids seen is from 2.5 to 6.8 with the average maginutid being 3.1650072744907956.

 
  
  # Conclusion:
  
  Accurate measurements of large scale weather systems can be made by widely space data collection devices due to the low lag rates and the strong correlation of data seen above.
